# Game Manager

GameManager.cs is the glue that connects all parts of the code together. It is that start point of the program. Now it has basic functionality, but if the project grew bigger, it would be the control center of other parts of the program.
As an example if campains with more battle scenarios were introduces, the Game manager would control every creation of the battle etc.
